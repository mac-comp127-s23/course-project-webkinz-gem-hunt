# Webkinz Gem Hunt Clone

## __Group Members: Aurora Hiveley, James McConnell, and Stephanie Miles__


## __Product Description__

Our team created a replica of Webkinz's daily gem hunt with minor tweaks to improve user experience. The game starts off with a map that allows the user to choose from five different mines. There is also a collection button present that shows which gemstones the user currently has obtained when clicked on. Once the user chooses a map, the canvas will be redrawn to the corresponding cave. Side-scrolling has been enabled, so the user is able to scroll and choose which rocks they want to attempt to mine. Once a rock is clicked on, there are some rock-breaking graphics implemented and the screen will show what has been found (either SLAG or a gemstone). The user can then decide to mine for more gems in that cave, or return to the main map and choose a different mine. The "winning: objective is to have the user collect all 30 gemstones. Once this has been achieved, the user will recieve a crown.

## __Goals:__

Our team wants to create a clone of Webkinz’s daily gem hunt game. The project's core goals include a map that allows the player to select one of the five different mines and mine for gems in each one. Each gemstone and mine will have some sort of graphics component and description. The peripheral goals include side scrolling within the mine (with a minecart graphic), gem collections, pickaxe cursor graphics/animation, and reworking Webkinz’s game logic. If some peripheral goals cannot be completed, we will focus on elevating the core goals. Because the topic is largely visual, there will be only a few unit tests done. The testing will be done by actually playing the game and drawing the canvas. The testing will be similar to the one done in the Breakout assignment. The project will mostly be utilizing Kilt Graphics for graphics, Math/Random for gem generation probabilities, and a scanner to read a spreadsheet of gemstone data.
